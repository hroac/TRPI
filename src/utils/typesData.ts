Known for their appreciation of beauty and their spontaneous nature, they often express themselves through artistic or physical actions rather than words. ISFPs value personal freedom and authenticity, preferring to follow their own path. Though they are kind and considerate, their preference for personal freedom can sometimes make them appear reserved or difficult to get to know. In \"Flight\" mode, ISFPs prioritize retreat from conflict, channeling tension into personal passions or artistic outlets. They temporarily disengage, using sensory or creative experiences as an emotional sanctuary until they feel safe to reemerge.",
