      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The Trauma Response Personality Indicator (TRPI) combines elements of the MBTI, Big Five traits, and the 4F trauma
        response system to provide insights into personality. Itâ€™s rooted in the idea that responses to stress and trauma
        play a significant role in personality development, influencing our information processing, social interactions,
        and coping mechanisms.
